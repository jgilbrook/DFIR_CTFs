Title: Data Snoop - Solution Guide

1. Open the provided PCAP file in Wireshark or any other network analysis tool.
2. Filter DNS traffic using the display filter `dns`.
3. Identify DNS requests with unusual domains, such as those containing base64-encoded data.
4. Copy the base64-encoded data from the DNS queries.
5. Decode the base64 data using a base64 decoder (e.g., `echo -n 'base64_string' | base64 -d`).
6. The decoded data should reveal the flag, "the flag is FLAG{3xf1l_d@ng3r}". The traffic is coming from FLAG{192.168.70.11}

Additional Tips:
- You might need to search through multiple DNS requests to find all relevant payloads.
- Ensure that the decoded data matches the expected flag format.
